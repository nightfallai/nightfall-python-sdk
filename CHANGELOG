.. warning::
    This is a breaking change compared to all versions before it, using
    Nightfall's new APIs and adding in file scanning. Please check the
    new methods provided to migrate from the older API.

Version 0.6.0
-------------

Released on July 25, 2021

- Update scan and chunking interface to handle dict with multiple items
  instead of list of dicts.

.. warning::
    This is a breaking change compared to version 0.5.0, but all users are
    reccomended to upgrade to this version. This version represents an
    improvement on the previous iteration where instead of handling a list of
    dicts, we now handle a single dict with mulitple entries. This simplifies
    the library code and makes the interface much more usable.

    The previous version of the SDK required users to pass in a list of dicts.
    We now require users to pass in a single dict with multiple entries.
    ``nightfall.scan([{'id': 'string}])`` should now be
    ``nightfall.scan({'id': 'string'})``.

Version 0.5.0
-------------

Released on July 12, 2021

- Publish Sphinx docs to GitHub pages
- Split up unit and integration tests, use mocking for unit tests
- Update scan and chunking method to scan strings from a dict
- Stop attempting to split strings and instead raise an exception
- Redefine ``MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE`` constant to be actual max of 500_000 bytes
- Updated documentation to illustrate how to use debug logging with this library

.. warning::
    Scanning dicts instead of strings is a breaking change. Previous versions
    of the SDK accepted a list of strings for scanning. We now require users
    to pass in a list of dicts instead. ``nightfall.scan(['string'])`` should
    now be ``nightfall.scan([{'id': 'string'}])``. This allows you to keep
    track of the reference of where the string came from for further processing.

Version 0.4.0
-------------

Released on June 20, 2021

- Add debug logs to Nightfall module
- Change primary class name from ``Api`` to ``Nightfall`` to make things a bit
  more clear when this library is used in other programs and allow ``from
  nightfall import Nightfall``

.. warning::
    This is a breaking change, since the previous version of this SDK
    imported Nightfall using ``from nightfall.api import Api``

-------------

Released on June 13, 2021
