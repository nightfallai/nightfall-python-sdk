Changelog
=========

Here you can see the full list of changes between each Nightfall release.

Version 0.6.0
-------------

UNRELEASED

- Update scan and chunking interface to handle dict with multiple items 
  instead of list of dicts.

.. warning::
    This is a breaking change compared to version 0.5.0, but all users are 
    reccomended to upgrade to this version. This version represents an
    improvement on the previous iteration where instead of handling a list of
    dicts, we now handle a single dict with mulitple entries. This simplifies
    the library code and makes the interface much more usable.

    The previous version of the SDK required users to pass in a list of dicts. 
    We now require users to pass in a single dict with multiple entries. 
    ``nightfall.scan([{'id': 'string}])`` should now be 
    ``nightfall.scan({'id': 'string'})``.

Version 0.5.0
-------------

Released on July 12, 2021

- Publish Sphinx docs to GitHub pages
- Split up unit and integration tests, use mocking for unit tests
- Update scan and chunking method to scan strings from a dict
- Stop attempting to split strings and instead raise an exception
- Redefine ``MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE`` constant to be actual max of 500_000 bytes
- Updated documentation to illustrate how to use debug logging with this library

.. warning::
    Scanning dicts instead of strings is a breaking change. Previous versions
    of the SDK accepted a list of strings for scanning. We now require users
    to pass in a list of dicts instead. ``nightfall.scan(['string'])`` should
    now be ``nightfall.scan([{'id': 'string'}])``. This allows you to keep
    track of the reference of where the string came from for further processing.

Version 0.4.0
-------------

Released on June 20, 2021

- Add debug logs to Nightfall module
- Change primary class name from ``Api`` to ``Nightfall`` to make things a bit 
  more clear when this library is used in other programs and allow ``from 
  nightfall import Nightfall``

.. warning::
    This is a breaking change, since the previous version of this SDK
    imported Nightfall using ``from nightfall.api import Api``
