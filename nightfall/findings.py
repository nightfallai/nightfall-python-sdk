        finding (str): The data that triggered a detector match.

        before_context (str): The data that immediately preceded the finding if configured, None otherwise.
        after_context (str): The data that immediately succeeded the finding if configured, None otherwise.
        detector_name (str): The the name of the detector, if configured, None otherwise.
        detector_uuid (str): The ID that uniquely identifies this detector.
        confidence (Confidence): The confidence that the data contained in Finding is an instance of the matched
            detector.
        byte_range (Range): The byte range in which a finding was detected within the item.
        codepoint_range (Range): The codepoint range in which a finding was detected within the item. This differs
            from byte range since a codepoint may contain multiple bytes.
        row_range (Range): The row in which a finding was detected, if it was in a tabular document. Index starts at 1.
        column_range (Range): The column(s) in which a finding was detected, if it was in a tabular document. Index starts at 1.
        commit_hash (str): The hash of the commit in which the finding was detected, if known.
        commit_author(str): The author of the commit in which the finding was detected, if known.
        matched_detection_rule_uuids (List[str]): The list of detection rule UUIDs that contained a detector that
            triggered a match.
        matched_detection_rules (List[str]): The list of inline detection rules that contained a detector that triggered
            a match.
