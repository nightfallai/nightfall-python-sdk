        detector_uuid (str): The ID that uniquely identifies this detector.
        confidence (Confidence): The confidence that the data contained in Finding is an instance of the matched
            detector.
        byte_range (Range): The byte range in which a finding was detected within the item.
        codepoint_range (Range): The codepoint range in which a finding was detected within the item. This differs
            from byte range since a codepoint may contain multiple bytes.
        commit_hash (str): The hash of the commit in which the finding was detected, if known.
